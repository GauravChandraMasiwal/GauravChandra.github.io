									<h1>This is a page <br />
									about myself and my journey to data science field</h1>
									<p>Hi! I am Gaurav Chandra and I am from New Delhi,India. I have done my Bachelors in Physics Hons ,so a doubt can be arised about my interest and journey in Data Science Field.<br />
									So, In my 11th and 12th grade I had Computer Science with Python Programming as a core subject and from there I grew up some interest in Python and SQL and I have also developed some basic knowledge about them too.<br />
									In my Graduation Years ,from the very first semester we had python labs as one of the core subject labs. These labs brought the coder inside of me out, when my colleagues were not able to grasp the python programs as they had no experience in it, I used to guide them with assignments and projects. I was doing much better in labs as compared to other classes. Due to this I started giving more time to my programming skills and started furnishing my pandas and numpy skills. I had these python labs in almost each of my semester and due to this I have gained a good experience in writing programs in python.
									<br/>I am still not a master in Python ,but all these labs and learning made me gain a very strong interest in this field. During one of these labs ,I had developed a weighted least square fitting model program in python which is used to fit data .With this program ,I started having interest in linear Regression and machine learning.
								<br/>After The completion of my Graduation, I started creating some projects on my own and by using some guidance from the YouTube. I then joined a course on Data Science Professional Course on Coursera provided by IBM .With these coursers, I gained some industry based knowledge of SQL, Dashboarding ,Pandas and some other things.
								<br/>Right Now, I am applying for a job for Data Analyst so that I can get entry in the industry based data science and soon I'll make my way up to Data Engineer .
								<br/>ThankYou for Reading ðŸ™‚ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜‰
